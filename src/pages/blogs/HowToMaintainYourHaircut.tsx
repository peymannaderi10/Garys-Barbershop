                Getting a great haircut is just the beginning. With 34+ years of experience at <a href="/" className="text-barber-primary hover:underline">Gary's Barbershop</a>, I've learned that proper maintenance between visits is crucial for keeping your style looking sharp and extending the life of your cut.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-barber-primary mt-8 mb-4">The First 48 Hours: Critical Care Period</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The first two days after your haircut are crucial. Your hair needs time to settle into its new shape, and how you treat it during this period affects how long your style will last.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Avoid washing your hair for at least 24 hours to let the cut settle</li>
                <li>Sleep on a clean pillowcase to prevent oils from affecting your new style</li>
                <li>Resist the urge to touch or run your fingers through your hair excessively</li>
                <li>If you must style it, use minimal product and gentle movements</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-barber-primary mt-8 mb-4">Proper Washing Techniques</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                How you wash your hair significantly impacts how long your cut looks fresh. Here's what I recommend to my clients at Gary's Barbershop:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Wash every 2-3 days unless you have very oily hair</li>
                <li><strong>Water temperature:</strong> Use lukewarm water to avoid stripping natural oils</li>
                <li><strong>Shampoo technique:</strong> Focus on the scalp, not the hair ends</li>
                <li><strong>Conditioning:</strong> Apply conditioner from mid-length to ends, avoiding the roots</li>
                <li><strong>Drying:</strong> Pat dry with a towel, don't rub vigorously</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-barber-primary mt-8 mb-4">Styling Between Visits</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The right styling approach can make your haircut look fresh for weeks. Here are my professional recommendations:
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-barber-primary mt-6 mb-3">Product Selection</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Pomade:</strong> Great for classic styles and slicked-back looks</li>
                <li><strong>Hair wax:</strong> Provides texture and hold for modern styles</li>
                <li><strong>Hair cream:</strong> Perfect for natural-looking styles with light hold</li>
                <li><strong>Sea salt spray:</strong> Adds texture and volume for casual looks</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-barber-primary mt-6 mb-3">Application Tips</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Start with a small amount - you can always add more</li>
                <li>Warm the product between your palms before applying</li>
                <li>Work from back to front, then style as desired</li>
                <li>Use a comb or brush for precise styling</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-barber-primary mt-8 mb-4">When to Schedule Your Next Appointment</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Knowing when to book your next visit is key to maintaining a consistently sharp look. Here's my general timeline:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Fade cuts:</strong> 2-3 weeks for optimal freshness</li>
                <li><strong>Regular haircuts:</strong> 4-6 weeks depending on hair growth</li>
                <li><strong>Longer styles:</strong> 6-8 weeks for shape maintenance</li>
                <li><strong>Beard trims:</strong> 2-4 weeks to maintain shape</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-barber-primary mt-8 mb-4">Common Maintenance Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In my 34 years of barbering, I've seen these mistakes repeatedly. Avoid them to keep your cut looking professional:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Over-washing, which strips natural oils and affects style</li>
                <li>Using too much product, making hair look greasy or stiff</li>
                <li>Attempting to trim it yourself - leave it to the professionals</li>
                <li>Ignoring your hair type when choosing products</li>
                <li>Waiting too long between appointments</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-barber-primary mt-8 mb-4">Professional Touch-Ups</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Sometimes you need a quick professional touch-up between full cuts. At Gary's Barbershop, we offer <a href="/services" className="text-barber-primary hover:underline">line-up services</a> to keep your edges crisp and clean.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Remember, a good haircut is an investment in your appearance and confidence. Proper maintenance ensures you get the maximum value from each visit to the barbershop.
              </p>
